   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

3. **Development Guidelines**:
   - Follow Go best practices and conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Ensure all tests pass: `make test`
   - Run linting: `make lint`
   - Verify manifests are up-to-date: `make generate && make manifests`

     ```

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run `make test` to execute unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure your changes work with actual CNPG clusters
- **End-to-End Tests**: Run `make test-e2e` if available
- **Manual Testing**: Test in a real Kubernetes cluster with CNPG

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add or update code comments for complex logic
- Update examples in `examples/` directory
- Update API documentation in CRD spec comments

### Submitting Changes

   - Reference related issues
   - Ensure all checks pass

3. **Review Process**:
   - Maintainers will review your PR
   - Address any feedback or requested changes
   - Once approved, your PR will be merged

## Development Standards
